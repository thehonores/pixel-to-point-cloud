# Pixel to Point Cloud: 3D Vision Pipeline Workshop

Welcome to the "Pixel to Point Cloud" workshop repository! This project is designed to guide you through building a comprehensive 3D vision pipeline, transforming 2D images into 3D point clouds using Python and computer vision techniques.

## Deliverables

The following [workshop website](https://martvald.github.io/oaf-3d-vision-pipeline-workshop/) is my deliverable for this project. Each participant will create their own fork of the repository and host their own version of the website.

## Workshop Schedule

1. Introduction to 3D Vision
2. Understanding Camera Models
3. Image Distortion and Undistortion
4. 3D-2D Projections and PnP
5. Dual Camera Setups
6. Stereo Matching Fundamentals
7. From Disparity to Depth
8. Building Your 3D Vision Pipeline
