# # Introduction
#
# Welcome to the "Pixel to Point Cloud" workshop repository! This project is designed
# to guide you through building a comprehensive 3D vision pipeline, transforming 2D
# images into 3D point clouds using Python and computer vision techniques.
#
# ## Overview
#
# This [repository](https://github.com/thehonores/pixel-to-point-cloud)
# contains materials for an 8-week workshop series that will introduce you to the
# fascinating world of 3D computer vision. Whether you're a beginner or have some
# programming experience, this course will help you understand and implement key
# concepts in 3D vision.
#
# ## Deliverables
#
# The following [workshop website](https://thehonores.github.io/pixel-to-point-cloud/)
# is my deliverable for this project. Each participant will create their own fork of
# the repository and host their own version of the website.
